# CardView-RecyclerView-Picasso-Practice

We'll design [this type] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasancse91/CardView-RecyclerView-Picasso-Practice/master/app_screenshot.png) of sample Android App.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasancse91/CardView-RecyclerView-Picasso-Practice/master/app_screenshot.png" width="250" height="444" />

Upper portion contains a Horizontal Scroller. Lower portion contains a vertical scroller. Both are created with RecyclerView.

All data will come from [this API] (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82144031/All%20Public%20JSON%20API/CardView-RecyclerView-Picasso-Test/cardView_recyclerView_picasso_test.json) in JSON format.

I used here:
- CardVeiw
- RecyclerView
- Retrofit for network call
- Picasso for image loading
